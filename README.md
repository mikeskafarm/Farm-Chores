  3. When done editing a document, be sure to click the **commit changes** button at the bottom of the page.
  
  The *Preview Changes* tab is useful for evaluating what has changed in the document before committing. Lines of text removed from the file will begin with a red line marker. Lines of text added will begin with a green line marker. *When you change an existing line, the preview will show the initial content marked red and the replacement content marked green.*
