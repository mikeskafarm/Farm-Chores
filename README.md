# Instructions for Editing Tasks
  1. Click on the article you want to edit by clicking on the name and then click on the "Pencil" icon in the upper right corner of the text area.
  2. Make any desired changes. You can use [this article](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for assistance with formatting or reference [the official github markdown documentation](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
  3. When done editing a document, be sure to click the **commit changes** button at the bottom of the page.
  
  The *Preview Changes* tab is useful for evaluating what has changed in the document before committing. Unchanged lines of text begin with a yellow mark. Lines of text removed from the file during the current edit will begin with a red line marker. Lines of text added will begin with a green line marker. *When you change an existing line, the preview will show the initial content highlighted red and the replacement content highlighted green.*
